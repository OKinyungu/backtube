        "title":"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby",
        "description":"When America's number one NASCAR speed-demon is issued a direct challenge from a gay, French Formula One racer with a hunger for the top spot and a mean talent for tight-cornering, the race is on to become the number one man in all of NASCAR in a full throttle comedy starring Will Ferrell and directed by Anchorman cohort Adam McKay. Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) is a national hero with a \"smokin' hot\" trophy wife, pair of borderline-abusively precocious sons, and an endless line of endorsement deals filling his mansion with toys and driveway with sports cars and Hummers. His racing partner and lifelong friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), never fails to provide him with a hand on the racetrack, frequently performing their trademark \"slingshot\" maneuver to shoot Ricky into first place, leaving Cal in second. While the public loves these buddies (popularly known by the meaningless childhood nicknames they find so exceedingly cool: \"Shake and Bake\"), a wedge comes between the two, as Ricky Bobby's longstanding winning-streak is broken by flamboyand French Formula One driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), robbing Ricky of everything in an instant as the trauma leaves him unable to drive. Ricky's wife takes his fortunes while Cal takes his wife, and now he's back with his mother (Jane Lynch) and long-estranged father (Gary Cole). Things look bad for Ricky, but his father was once a race car driver himself, and now with the help of a training montage, a live cougar, and the courage to drive without his gleaming white Wonder Bread endorsement, Ricky might be ready to face the track again.",

Phil displays a charm and wit on camera that evaporates the moment the red light goes off; he is bitter, appallingly self-centered, and treats his co-workers with contempt, especially his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot). On February 2, 1992, Phil, Rita, and Larry are sent on an assignment that Phil especially loathes: the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, PA, where the citizens await the appearance of Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who will supposedly determine the length of winter by his ability to see his own shadow. Phil is eager to beat a hasty retreat, but when a freak snowstorm strands him in Punxsutawney, he wakes up the next morning with the strangest sense of déjà vu: he seems to be living the same day over again. The next morning it happens again, and then again. Soon, no matter what he does, he's stuck in February 2, 1992; not imprisonment nor attempted suicide nor kidnapping the groundhog gets him out of the loop. But the more Phil relives the same day, the more he's forced to look at other people's lives, and something unusual happens: he begins to care about others. He starts to respect people, he tries to save the life of a homeless man, and he discovers that he's falling in love with Rita and therefore wants to be someone that she could love in return.","tags":["Groundhog Day","Bill Murray","Andie MacDowell","Chris Elliott","Stephen Tobolowsky","comedy","romance","time warp","funny","Crackle","movie","feature film"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_2OSZV8OlN4/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_2OSZV8OlN4/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2OSZV8OlN4&feature=youtube_gdata_player"},"duration":6069,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":4.909091,"likeCount":"301","ratingCount":308,"viewCount":26867,"favoriteCount":232,"commentCount":80,"status":{"value":"restricted","reason":"limitedSyndication"},"contentRating":{"all":"pg"},"restrictions":[{"type":"country","relationship":"allow","countries":"US"}],"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"allowed","rate":"allowed","embed":"denied","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"denied"}},{"id":"FFlVJvg4qng","uploaded":"2011-11-12T00:47:30.000Z","updated":"2012-01-31T13:58:00.000Z","uploader":"Crackle","category":"Movies","title":"The International","description":"Clive Owen and Naomi Watts star in Run Lola Run director Tom Tykwer's action thriller concerning an ambitious Interpol agent who targets corruption at the top levels of the world's largest banking institutions.

An energetic child with a vivid imagination, Toby Morgan (Matthew Harbour) lives with his father (Kevin Jubinville), a successful businessman who seemed to shut down emotionally following the death of Toby's mother. When Toby is sent to spend the Christmas holidays with his loving but stern grandmother (Una Kay), he wanders through the lonely house until he eventually discovers the \"magic attic\" that was once his father's childhood playroom. There, Toby is surprised to find that his mother left him a stuffed velveteen rabbit -- her final gift to her beloved son. Hugging the rabbit close as he starts to cry, the grieving boy watches in wonder as his tears magically bring the toy to life. Before long, Toby is frolicking in the enchanted attic with a whole new group of friends, including the impetuous Horse (voiced by Tom Skerritt) and the wise but skittish Swan (voice of Ellen Burstyn). Toby's one wish is to spend Christmas with his father, and Rabbit's one wish is to someday hop across the fields as a real rabbit. Later, when Toby falls seriously ill, the courageous Rabbit helps him to win over his grandmother and make a full recovery. When Toby's father returns in time for Christmas, the power of the young child's love grants the Velveteen Rabbit its one true wish.","tags":["velveteen rabbit","easter bunny","peter rabbit","beatrix potter","cat in the hat","dr. seuss","wow wow wubbzy","hey gabba gabba","chuggington","thomas the tank engine","children","family","kids","nickelodeon","hub","disney","starz","anchor bay"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hh5IWXFP4Vc/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hh5IWXFP4Vc/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh5IWXFP4Vc&feature=youtube_gdata_player","mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v=Hh5IWXFP4Vc"},"duration":5305,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":4.7714286,"likeCount":"99","ratingCount":105,"viewCount":0,"favoriteCount":83,"commentCount":0,"contentRating":{"all":"g"},"accessControl":{"comment":"moderated","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"denied","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"h3rAItM0lMw","uploaded":"2011-03-15T16:37:48.000Z","updated":"2012-01-31T13:08:08.000Z","uploader":"NollywoodLove","category":"Movies","title":"BlackBerry Babes","description":"http://irokotv.com/\r\n\r\nThe invention of the new Blackberry Series spontanously defines the kind of friends or clique you will belong in the society.

Garrett is a boy who has always been close to nature. He lives on a reserve with a menagerie of orphaned animals, and over the years he's become especially sensitive to the nutritional needs of the diet-sensitive animals he's charged with caring for. When Garrett's mother suffers a tragic and untimely death, the boy falls into a dangerous downward spiral and nearly flunks out of school. Increasingly concerned for Garrett's well-being and determined to strengthen their bond despite the many challenges on the horizon, his father makes the decision to begin home-schooling the distressed teen. Garrett's first assignment: study a controversial book written by Dr. Max Gerson, a physician who claims to have discovered a diet that's capable of curing cancer. Is Dr. Gerson's therapy truly the legitimate, alternative cure it appears to be? In order to find out the truth behind this long-suppressed treatment, Garrett interviews not only Dr. Gerson's family members, but various doctors, skeptics, and cancer patients as well. His studies completed and his findings revelatory, Garrett now sets out to tell the entire world about The Gerson Miracle.","tags":["The Beautiful Truth","Alaska","alternative","treatment","cancer","survivors","cure","diet","doctors","Dr. Max Gerson","home school medicine","natural scientists","wildlife","The Gerson Therapy"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvzDHGLEUyw/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvzDHGLEUyw/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvzDHGLEUyw&feature=youtube_gdata_player","mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v=wvzDHGLEUyw"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/wvzDHGLEUyw?version=3&f=movie_chart&app=youtube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v8.cache3.c.youtube.com/CicLENy73wIaHgksU8RiHMP8whMYDSANFEgGUgttb3ZpZV9jaGFydAw=/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v3.cache7.c.youtube.com/CicLENy73wIaHgksU8RiHMP8whMYESARFEgGUgttb3ZpZV9jaGFydAw=/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":5495,"rating":4.9150915,"likeCount":"3366","ratingCount":3439,"viewCount":401099,"favoriteCount":3511,"commentCount":951,"contentRating":{"all":"pg-13"},"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"clZ-hMRQ884","uploaded":"2011-10-17T09:30:06.000Z","updated":"2012-01-31T16:18:03.000Z","uploader":"shreeinternational","category":"Movies","title":"MOD","description":"\"MOD\" the film is is about a 25 year old girl named Aranya (Ayesha Takia), who lives in a hill station called Ganga.

In the year 2005, a nuclear attack wipes out part of the state of Texas, and three years later America is a virtual police state, with the government taking control of nearly every part of people's lives, supposedly for their own good. A German firm has found a way to generate energy using seawater, but both public and private concerns are desperate to prevent the new technology from being introduced in the gasoline-starved United States. A Marxist underground based on the West Coast is determined to bring down the federal government through violent revolution.\n\nIn this midst of this chaos, we follow a number of stories that continually return to three principle characters. Boxer Santaros (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) is an actor famous for his role in action films; he's trying to secure financing for a new project, but reality keeps mirroring the events in his script and he struggles to hold on to his identity following a bout with amnesia. Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a porn star who is reinventing herself as a television pundit offering her views on politics, contemporary culture, and teenage sex. And Roland Taverner (Seann William Scott) is an L.A. police officer whose identity has mysteriously split in two, and he struggles to track down his other half. Featuring a massive supporting cast which includes Mandy Moore, Miranda Richardson, Wallace Shawn, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Smith, Amy Poehler, and Justin Timberlake, Southland Tales received its world premiere at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival; director Kelly also created an accompanying series of three graphic novels that chart these events and characters prior to this story.","tags":["SOUTHLAND TALES","Dwayne The Rock Johnson","Seann William Scott","Sarah Michelle Gellar","Mandy Moore","Jon Lovitz","Wallace Shawn","John Larroquette","Moby","Richard Kelly"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkj8hpM1HFA/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkj8hpM1HFA/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkj8hpM1HFA&feature=youtube_gdata_player"},"duration":8686,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":3.9813952,"likeCount":"641","ratingCount":860,"viewCount":81409,"favoriteCount":596,"commentCount":383,"status":{"value":"restricted","reason":"limitedSyndication"},"contentRating":{"all":"r"},"restrictions":[{"type":"country","relationship":"allow","countries":"CA US"}],"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"denied","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"denied"}},{"id":"83m1Mm8F8CU","uploaded":"2011-10-06T04:37:45.000Z","updated":"2012-01-31T16:18:01.000Z","uploader":"erosentertainment","category":"Movies","title":"Om Shanti Om","description":"Love and dreams follow two starry-eyed actors across three decades and two incarnations in this splashy Hindi musical. It's the early '70s, and Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) is a young would-be actor who has been playing bit parts in Bollywood musicals while looking for his big break. Om's ambition is to become a film star and win the heart of beautiful screen siren Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone), and his pal Pappu (Shreyas Talpade) and his mother, Bela (Kirron Kher), both encourage him not to give up on his dreams. One day, Om meets Shantipriya on a movie set, and he feels as if destiny is finally smiling on him, but when he overhears her having an argument with studio chief Mukesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal), Om senses things are not as they should be. Before Om can decide what to make of his misgivings, the studio burns to the ground, claiming the lives of Om and Shantipriya. Thirty years later, a bit of Om's spirit seems to live on in Om Kapoor (also played by Shah Rukh Khan), a popular film actor with a large ego and a fear of flame who was born the day the old studio burned down. Despite his fame, Om is lonely, at least until he meets Sandhya (also played by Deepika Padukone), a shy but eager would-be actress looking for her chance to become a star. Om Shanti Om was directed and co-written by Farah Khan, who was a top choreographer in the Indian film industry before moving up to the director's chair, and features guest spots from a number of Bollywood's greatest stars, a few appearing in the form of digital recreations taken from films of the '70s.","tags":["eros","entertainment","bollywood","international","erosentertainment","om","shanti","2007","srk","shah","rukh","khan","movies","sexy","deepika","padukone","hot","six","packs","darde","disco","arjun","rampal","farah","gauri","kirron","kher","shreyas","talpade","marathi","actor","reincarnation","full","movie","hd","box","office","red","chillies","ent","vishal","shekhar","indian","films","desi","aankhon","mein","teri","ajab","si","deewangi","jag","soona","suna","lage","dhoom","tana","shaan","udit","narayan","shreya","ghoshal","sunidhi","chauhan","sonu","nigam","caralisa","monteiro","kayk","sukhwinder","singh","best","direction"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/83m1Mm8F8CU/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/83m1Mm8F8CU/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83m1Mm8F8CU&feature=youtube_gdata_player","mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v=83m1Mm8F8CU"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/83m1Mm8F8CU?version=3&f=movie_chart&app=youtube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v4.cache4.c.youtube.com/CicLENy73wIaHgkl8AVvMrV58xMYDSANFEgGUgttb3ZpZV9jaGFydAw=/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v4.cache6.c.youtube.com/CicLENy73wIaHgkl8AVvMrV58xMYESARFEgGUgttb3ZpZV9jaGFydAw=/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":10135,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":4.669173,"likeCount":"976","ratingCount":1064,"viewCount":477001,"favoriteCount":1251,"commentCount":235,"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"denied","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"jwDPL-EXi2U","uploaded":"2011-07-14T11:10:59.000Z","updated":"2012-01-31T06:27:35.000Z","uploader":"VenusMovies","category":"Movies","title":"Love Express","description":"London-based Kanav Chhadha is pressured by his parents to marry Amritsar-based Ashmeet Kaur, the non-graduate daughter of Sujan Singh, a childhood friend of Kanav's dad.
